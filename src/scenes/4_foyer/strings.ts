    PARA_1: `Hi Lawrence, me again. Sorry for the delay. Your funeral was the day before last. I haven't felt like writing lately.`,
    PARA_2: `I don't know what I'm doing. I miss you so much. I just need to talk to you in some way, any way, even through this diary. Life feels so quiet right now, I have so little to do, it seems all I have time to do is think. Think and remember.`,
    PARA_3: `When you got sick, you needed to lie in bed in just the right way, and stopped being able to hold me the way you used to. Over time, I actually forgot what it felt like to fall asleep to the warmth of your breath on my shoulders. I remember things like that now.`,
    PARA_4: `When you came along, I was just getting accustomed to the joy of discovery, the confidence that came with standing on my own two feet. I never expected how much I would enjoy having you sweeping me off them.`,
    PARA_5: `It took a while, but eventually I felt safe enough to tell you what it was like for me growing up. I told you I never wanted to be one of those girls that crossed the foyer of my father's house, barely seeing the sunlight before she was once again cloistered under her husband's roof. You understood completely. I knew I loved you then.`,
    PARA_6: `I surprised my friends when I told you “yes” when you proposed, you know. Again, when you got sick, I surprised everyone at the firm when I turned in my request for an unpaid leave of absence. I was just so determined to nurse you back to health. My mother always called me an impulsive child, someone prone to “breaking everything I touched”. Maybe it would have surprised her that you were getting better`,
    PARA_7: `I'm just full of surprises, I guess.`,
