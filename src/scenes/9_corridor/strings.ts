    PARA_1: `I don't know how to explain what happened last night.`,
    PARA_2: `The sound of a pin drop could wake me up these days. I woke up to the sound of footsteps nearing my room, just before stopping in front of the door. My eyes were closed, I did not move an inch. Just listened. Suddenly, I could hear the steps inside my room and approaching the foot of my bed. `,
    PARA_3: `I never heard the door open. Not even the squeak of the door jamb.`,
    PARA_4: `The impossibility sent my brain reeling. It became the least of my problems when I became aware of the subtle sensation of the mattress shifting next to me. I could hardly breathe at this point, terrified at what I might happen if I moved a muscle, let alone turned around.`,
    PARA_5: `And then suddenly, I started to feel warmth against my shoulders.`,
    PARA_6: `As quickly as it began, it was gone. I don't quite remember falling asleep. When I awoke, the daylight was already shining thinly between the iron grates of my window. I can't just shake off what happened last night.`,
    PARA_7: `Are you here with me, Lawrence? Why did you come to me last night? Are you trying to warn me of something?`,
