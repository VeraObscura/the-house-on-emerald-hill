    PARA_1: `Your mother, Mrs. Chen - though she insists I call her Auntie Shu -  has taken it upon herself to make me feel as comfortable here as possible. She even had my breakfast brought to my room on a tray this morning.`,
    PARA_2: `Over breakfast, she introduced me to the kitchen staff, who I'm told will attend to all of my meals. My Mandarin was very rusty, but I managed some broken introductions. Camille is a young, slightly skittish woman just younger than me. Hwee is the head housekeeper. She still takes great pride in her work well into her eighties. The decades have clearly wrought friendship between her and your mother that glows in their every interaction.`,
    PARA_3: `Your father Mr. Chen assured me he was equally happy to have me there, but needed to depart quickly for work that day.`,
    PARA_4: `William was very courteous and polite when he chatted with me. He's barely thirteen, and already starting to wear that mantle of the young man of the house. It made my heart ache. It can't be easy being the middle child in a family when you were his older brother.`,
    PARA_5: `Emily is eight now. When she was called to meet me, she refused to come out of her room, and chose to  watch me through a crack in her bedroom door. Your mother was a little embarrassed about it, saying she was just shy. Honestlyâ€¦I don't think Emily liked me very much.`,
