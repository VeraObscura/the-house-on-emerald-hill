    PARA_1: `Hey Lawrence, I arrived at the House on Emerald Hill today. So this is where you grew up?.`,
    PARA_2: `It was raining when I finally got into Singapore. The flight was long. It's just past 1am as I'm writing this. I'm sitting at a bureau in the room your mother has prepared for me to stay in for the next week. The window in front me overlooks the small alley behind the house.`,
    PARA_3: `Singapore is probably different here from when you grew up here. All these tall buildings and gleaming chrome remind me of the covers of those sci-fi novels you used to collect. I have to admit, I thought there was a mistake when my taxi pulled up to the house. Even in the darkness and the rain, it is imposing in its faded grandeur. A shophouse, I think the driver called it? Said that many of them are being torn down to make way for new development.`,
    PARA_4: `Your family, bless them, greeted me when I got in. I hope I didn't seem unfriendly. It's just been a whirlwind and I've been so tired. They all seemed so kind. It's both strange and sweet to get to know them at last.`,
    PARA_5: `I know we both agreed to never speak about our families, though mostly at my request. Even when you asked me to marry you, the most I heard was their distant voices on the phone as you alone spoke with them. `,
    PARA_6: `So when your family sent for you to be returned for the funeral, I was surprised they even invited me. Even more so when they paid for my plane ticket. I suppose people do feel sorry for widows. Can I be called a widow if we never actually walked down the aisle?`,
    PARA_7: `I guess the question remains as to why I would choose to accept, to come here, a world away from home. The truth is, that I just needed to get away. Too much in London reminds me of you now.`,
    PARA_8: `I'm going to bed now, it's getting late. More tomorrow. Goodnight, sweet.`,
