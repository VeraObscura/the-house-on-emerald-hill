    PARA_1: `Your mother and William took me to the zoo today. `,
    PARA_2: `When I was thirteen, the bone basket of my hips erupted under my skin. The stretchmarks expanded almost overnight, leaving the thin pale gold slashes on my skin. My mother gave me a cream to reduce their appearance, but they never faded. I remember how you used to run your fingertips across them, how you called me - and would embarrass me, I might add - your little tiger.`,
    PARA_3: `Did you know that the last tiger in Singapore was killed just 60 years ago? Your grandmother was alive then, maybe even saw it in the papers. That's what the plaque in fron the tiger exhibit tells me, anyway. The plaque also told me her name is Mei.`,
    PARA_4: `When I got to her enclosure, she was reclining on the top of a steep rock wall, blinking sleepily at the gaping schoolchildren and frantic parents. She seemedâ€¦exhausted. Sad even. And yet, she was the most beautiful thing I have seen here since I arrived.`,
    PARA_5: `I can see it in my mind, a beauty padding through the jungle, full of rage and sorrow as she stalks the hunter. What went through his mind as he whirled around to see her? Terror? Smug satisfaction?`,
    PARA_6: `No.`,
    PARA_7: `I bet he saw what I see now in Mei, now. I'm sure it was pure awe, love at first sight. Even as he pulls the trigger. Maybe she falls to the forest floor like so many pieces of a glass chandelier. Maybe it is the saddest day of his life.`,
