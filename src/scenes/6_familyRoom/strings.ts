    PARA_1: `Bad news. I called the firm yesterday, to touch base before I go back to work next week. Turns out those bastards, “had a change of mind” gave my job to some new hire. I have been working there for six years now, how the fuck could they do this. Money has been tight for so long,  I'm just about out of cash now too. I've barely enough for a month's rent when I get back home. I don't know what I'm going to do.`,
    PARA_2: `I told your mother about my predicament. I did not expect my voice to crack as it did. I am not one to normally cry in front of strangers. She held me anyway. She told me to cancel my flight home, that I could stay here as long as I needed, and that we would figure it out as a family. She's going to ask Mr. Chen if there might be a job at his company that could temp at.`,
    PARA_3: `I am not used to this, Lawrence.`,
    PARA_4: `As a child, I spent so much time fantasizing about being away from my own family, but never imagined I could just leave. As I got older and my parents expected me to make something of myself, new opportunities presented themselves. I started as an apprentice at the firm, and for the first time I had enough money to take just a few steps out of their orbit. I took a few more, and then a few more still. Before long, I was far away enough that I never looked back.`,
    PARA_5: `I was thinking today about the first shitty flat I ever rented at twenty. That indescribable feeling of peace and freedom as I lay on my bare mattress. One of my flatmates got drunk one night, yakked all over the living room floor, and neglected to clean it for a month. I could have cared less. I was free.`,
    PARA_6: `This is the second time I have ever wanted to stay in place. The first was with you.`,
    PARA_7: `Is this what family is?`,
