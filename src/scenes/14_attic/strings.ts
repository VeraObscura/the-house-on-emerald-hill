    PARA_1: `I left my bedroom with only my lighter. I managed to get into the bedroom, after Mrs. Chen had gone to sleep. The vase was too heavy to move with me, so I had to gingerly lift the lid and remove the key, and replace the lid. All without making a sound, all with Mrs Chen lying  asleep not two feet away from me.`,
    PARA_2: `When I unlocked the red door, I came to a narrow set of stairs, I climbed them carefully and came to a room light only a small window. It was stiflingly hot and humid up there. I groped around for a light switch for a minute or two before giving up and flicking on my lighter. And what I sawâ€¦`,
    PARA_3: `Then I thought I heard sounds downstairs and my heart started to race. I crept back downstairs as quietly and quickly as I could, locking the door behind me. I snuck back into the master suite, and started to carefully lift the lid of the vase on the shelf.`,
    PARA_4: `And that's when I heard the sharp intake of a breath from behind me. A moment later, screaming.`,
    PARA_5: `It all happened so fast. The vase fell from the shelf, shattered on the floor. Your mother was screaming and your dad leapt out of bed. I felt a sharp pain and then a pool of warmth at my feet. It turned out that I was bleeding.`,
    PARA_6: `Mr. Chen rushed me to the hospital where I had the shard of the broken vase removed from my foot, and twelve stitches put in. The doctor advised that I walk on crutches for the next two weeks as I heal up. Mr. Chen and Mrs. Chen asked me what I was doing in their room. I told them I must have been sleep walking.`,
    PARA_7: `Thinking about what I saw in that room makes me feel sick to my stomach. I don't know what any of it means. I just know I need to get out of here.`,
