    DATE: `October 6, 1991`,
    PARA_1: `I woke up with a start. I could hear sounds approaching my door again. I was suddenly wide awake and staring at the door to my bedroom, just expecting you to come in.`,
    PARA_2: `A minute later, I heard footsteps approach my closed bedroom door, before stopping just outside. I could hear my heartbeat pounding in my ears. Then, the footsteps simply stopped. A moment later, I hear the same footsteps turn around and continue down the hall until they were out of earshot. My eyes soon adjusted to the dark. It took about the same amount of time for me to work up the courage to get out of bed.`,
    PARA_3: `As quietly as I could, I crept into the hallway and padded quietly across the wooden floor. I nearly had a heart attack as a figure in white materialized out of the darkness. Heading towards me. I managed to take cover behind a tall armoire just in time.`,
    PARA_4: `It was your mother, her nightgown almost glowing in the faint light.`,
    PARA_5: `She walked right past me, and I realized then she was returning to bed. But from where?I noticed her concealing something in a fist.`,
    PARA_6: `I followed her at some distance until I could see her reach the master suite. Mr. Chen's snoring was loud enough to even further muffle my movements. From the darkness of the hallway, I watched Mrs. Chen slip something into the vase on the shelf to the left of her bed. I even heard the silvery clink of metal against the porcelain.`,
    PARA_7: `I've found it.`,
    PARA_8: `This was all two nights ago. Since then, I've stayed up at night to keep an eye on Mrs Chen's night time excursions. Now I know why she always looks tired, breaking her sleep every night to attend to the secrets behind that door.`,
    PARA_9: `I will have a narrow window of time to retrieve the key as she sleeps, and return it to its place before she wakes up. I can hardly sleep with this knowledge, but I must. Tomorrow is the night.`,
